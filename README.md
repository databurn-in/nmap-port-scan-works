# Nmap Port Scanning Techniques

This project tries to implement the port scanning concepts described in the "Nmap Network Scanning" book. You can find the online version of the book [here!](https://nmap.org/book/) Book index can be found [here!](https://nmap.org/book/toc.html)

This project tries to cover the 5th Chapter of the book titled "Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms". Although we don't cover the entire chapter and skip the Algorithms and SCTP and FTP techniques, we do cover all of the TCP and UDP port scanning techniques mentioned in the book.

The code uses [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) library to create and manipulate the IP, TCP, ICMP and UDP packets. 

## The Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to give you an idea about how each of those scanning techniques work. The explanation given in the Nmap book is converted into Python code here. As simple as that. Once you understand this code, you will know what Nmap is doing under the hood while it's scanning for ports.

If you want to start reading the code, we suggest that you read the code in the following order:

 1. [tcp_connect.py](/tcp_connect.py)
 2. [tcp_syn.py](/tcp_syn.py)
 3. [tcp_null_fin_xmas.py](/tcp_null_fin_xmas.py)
 4. [tcp_maimon.py](/tcp_maimon.py)
 5. [tcp_ack.py](/tcp_ack.py)
 6. [tcp_window.py](/tcp_window.py)
 7. [tcp_idle.py](/tcp_idle.py)
 8. [udp_scan.py](/udp_scan.py)
 9. [ip_protocol_scan.py](/ip_protocol_scan.py)

You can view more details on each of these techniques here: https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html

Here is a diagram to (kind of) summarize some of the TCP port scanning techniques:
